# Two Neuron Simulation

This project is a quick demonstration of the activation of one neuron from two input neurons.
I wasn't able to find a close demo of what I wanted, so I made one.

Stimulation, stimulation decay, and refractory period are demoed.



## Python version launch
``` bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
```
